        hello... my name is Saad Sayyed. I am 21 years old, living in the Pune
        city of Maharashtra. As this website portrays a minimal theme
        that&apos;s how my life is, I love being simple but yet subtle. I
        don&apos;t consider myself as an introvert but I am an antisocial
        extrovert being that doesn&apos;t want to be bothered by lames.

      <h4 className="lg:w-[80%]">
        I highly believe in GOD and without him I am nothing. My mind
        subconsciously thinks about ART of every sort 24/7. I love isolating
        myself to find out what I can manifest into reality. I am specializied
        in developing fullstack web based applications that serve a helping
        purpose to the community, I also make avant-garde clothing garments and
        design old gothic cathedral&apos;s architecture for their revival.

      <h4 className="lg:w-[80%]">
        I don&apos;t hate people who loves to gossip but that really is not my
        kind. So if you share the same mindset, I&apos;ll gladly accept you as
        my friend and I hope we&apos;ll collab to put something unique into this
        lovely universe. Below you will find a form, use that as a mode to talk
        to me. You can talk about literally anything, I&apos;ll try my best to
        help you get through it.
